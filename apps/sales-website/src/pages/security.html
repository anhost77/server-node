                <div class="security-point">
                    <h3>Ed25519 Cryptographic Signatures</h3>
                    <p>
                        Every command sent through ServerFlow is cryptographically signed using Ed25519,
                        the same elliptic curve cryptography used by Signal, OpenSSH, and TLS 1.3.
                        This mathematically guarantees that commands cannot be forged or tampered with.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="security-point">
                    <h3>Outbound-Only Connections</h3>
                    <p>
                        The ServerFlow agent on your server initiates all connections to our orchestrator.
                        We never connect to your server. This means:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No SSH keys to manage or leak</li>
                        <li>No open ports required on your firewall</li>
                        <li>No way for us to access your server directly</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="security-point">
                    <h3>Zero Credential Storage</h3>
                    <p>
                        We don't store your server credentials. Period. If ServerFlow's infrastructure
                        is compromised, attackers find nothing they can use to access your servers.
                        Your keys live only on your servers.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="security-point">
                    <h3>Open Source Agent</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our agent is 100% open source. You can audit every line of code that runs
                        on your server. We encourage security researchers to review our code and
                        report any vulnerabilities through our responsible disclosure program.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Data Privacy</h3>
                    <p>
                        ServerFlow processes minimal data: deployment commands and basic telemetry.
                        We never access your application code, database contents, or user data.
                        All data transmission is encrypted using TLS 1.3.
